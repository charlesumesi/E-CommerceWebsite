Hi, I do not own the copyright to any of the pictures in my catalog folder. I have simply taken them from the World Wide Web, mostly through Google search, and utilised them to illustrate my concept. I have neither sold, rented, nor received any money whatsoever for the pictures, and hope you will understand this if you happen to be the copyright owner of any of them. Thank you for your understanding.
